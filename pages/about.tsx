                Hi there! I am Dan Watson, the owner of Watson Studios. 
                I have been a photographer for over 20 years. I received a Master of Fine 
                Arts degree in Photography from the Savannah College of Art and Design 
                in 2005. After that I explored several areas of commercial and fine art 
                photogrpahy. I started shooting weddings in 2007 and immediately loved capturing
                the special moments between family and friends that occur at weddings. Along with
                that, as a photographer, I get to wear so many hats at a wedding. I am, of course,
                a documentary and portrait photographer, capturing your best looks and most important 
                moments. However, I also get to be a product photographer, 
                architectural photographer, party/dance/band/dj photographer,
